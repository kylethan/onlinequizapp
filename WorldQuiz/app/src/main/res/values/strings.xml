    <string name="How_to_play">This is a very special game genre Multiple Choice.\n\n
Similar to other MCQ games, you have the right to choose the answer A, B, C, or D. There are multiple ways to move to other questions: \n
        - Left or right swiping \n
        - question tab tapping \n
        - Using the arrow button \n\n
        However, you will not be able to make a second decision to change the answer if you have moved to another question.\n\n
        Hence, you need to try to give the most accurate answer! \n\n
After all, this is how World Quiz works!</string>
